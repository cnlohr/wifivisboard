THIS REPO CONTAINS A REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION FOR ESP-NOW ON THE ESP8266.  Also, previously "esp-freedom"

A project for a minimal reference swadge implemnetation.  

Specifically, this is being made for use with a sermonette for my youth group, to allow for "seeing" wifi. 
I did the initial design in about 2.5 hours on a flight from the hackaday supercon over twitter.
